        <p>Cecile-Anne Sison (Cecile) is student programmer living in Chicago. Currently the Instructional Technology Lead of the <a href="http://web.madstudio.northwestern.edu/">Media and Design Studio</a> at Northwestern University, she supports course enhancement for Undergraduate Humanities classes by creating digital projects and deploying digital tools. Her main interests lie in incorporating game design and game play into pedagogy. She hopes to develop tools, sites and software that can be used in academia.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Cecile's career has been a marriage of technical and visually creative endeavors, which is why coding seemed like the next logical step in her evolution. After living in Canada, Hong Kong and the Philippines, Cecile received her BS in Communication from Northwestern University with a major in Radio/Television/Film (focused on producing and cinematography). Her production experience includes a gamut of duties at various levels (student, studio and independent), including leading hundred-person crews. These projects have honed her problem solving and collaborative skills. After college she spent many years working for the Mellon International Dunhuang Archive (housed on <a href="https://www.artstor.org/">ARTstor</a>) as both a member of the photography team on location in China and as a scholar/metadata specialist. Having lived and worked all over the world, she is mindful and open to other points of view. Other interests include travel, throwing theme parties, Pokemon Go, archery and finding new projects to collaborate on. She is eager to learn!</p>
